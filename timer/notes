Possible Implementation

- event listener watches for click on start button
  - draw full border around timer
  - start counting down timer 
  - each time timer counts down, update border
  - each time timer counts down, update text
  - if we counted down and timer reaches 0
    - reset the border
    - reset internal timer for another run

**Or Isolate responsibility rather than chain through**

- event listener watches for click on start button
  - emit event stating timer has started. When it occurs draw border
  - start counting down timer 
  - emit event that the timer has ticked. When it occurs update the border
  - each time timer counts down, update text
  - if we counted down and timer reaches 0
    - emit event that the timer is done. when it occurs reset the border
    - reset internal timer for another run
